Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges

One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages

Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live

Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'

Now I'm sitting as pretty as each penny is, while I'm penning this in the lab on you guinea pigs
I'm finna' fool, I'm in effect, gimmie the semi and when I pull the big guns out
That trigger pull it until the motherfuckin' shit runs out of bullets

It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go
You can hate me now (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now (Uh)
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now
Don't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)
Close your eyes (That's right), picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (You the best, that's right)
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest
Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now

You can hate me now
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?
Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (Yeah)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin' up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord (Uh)
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (You tried?)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you hate)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now

I like Disaronno, but if not, I fuck with Henny
No mixer or juice, I'm Papoose, stuck with Remy
On the day of the party man got deets like Uncle Temi
Mice, talking heavy, I'll do my man like George and Lennie
My old ting doing Oloni threads, oh, fuck, you must be kidding?
Last week came for dicking, it's a crazy world we live in
Girls say I'm a gigolo, no Piccolo, get shaved like Krillin
My life a movie, it's thrilling
Tom Hardy, I play the villain
Half the ends is real, and the other half is phoney
They see a Lambo in Vale, don't know if it's me or Pastor Tobi
If my girl knew how many times I turned that down and passed to brodie
I mean holy moly
Look, I know he seems active from far
But I know my man and he's far from active
k in the South of France and I hardly snapped it
I ain't gotta plan no party, party banged and we hardly planned it
Ratchet girl, rent her in the centre like parking campus
I took my one Casa, would've been Nob but I'm done with Asian
Whole body amazing, from high school my girl, she done raving
A rapid payment, the only G on the check I'm taking
Told bro that the ends is flaming
'Cause I just seen feds in a Volvo
Two jakes and an interceptor
That girl don't know about realness
No illness, I'm an influenza
Santan, that's SW and I got one six in my name like Kenza
How my man say he's a member
And ain't been ends since early November?
Fuck that guy and his agenda, remember I'm trying a ting
Shotgun barrel, Siamese twins
And we got that link from the Guyanese twins
I ain't got time for talking shit
Or call it quits
Touch Juss, man turn nutter
And make the ting stutter like an awkward chick
My young gunner wanna out that white
Are you about that life?
I got hands on her inner thigh
She got hands in my Calvin Klein
Free yard, Aggro Santos
Take pant off and the house is mine
I was a neek around that time
Then I went upsi and I found my spine
I said babe, if you wanna be mine, gotta hold it down like Bonnie and Clyde
Actin' crazy
Me and bro-bro just took a loss, but we share that pain like Max and Stacey
I'm top styler, got Naila, I'm like AJ Tracey
Talkin' don't phase me

Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts

I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward

""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate

You the moral to the story? You endorsin'? Mothafucka, I don't even like you (Like you) Corrupt a man's heart with a gift (With a gift) That's how you find out who you dealin' with (Dealin' with) A small percentage who I'm buildin' with (Buildin' with) I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin' On my mama, that's the realest shit You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] Love, let's talk about love Is it anything and everything you hoped for?

Da, da
I love Black folk (Black)
Black look like a revolution (Black)
Look like a family reunion in the park
Black look like it's a different world
Sound like a crawfish boil in New Orleans
Black folk joke around like Martin and got paintings from JJ in the living room
It sounds strong, look like sacrifice
It be, flowers blooming in the summertime
Black sound like old songs, smell like good food
And it tastes like heart disease
But it feel like maze at Jazz Fest
Black sound like something that hurt, like a hard test
Black sound like skin, like something dark
It look like hair, yeah, Black sound like rough hair, and good hair
Look like history, sound spiritual
Black sound like years, like working, like night
Black sound like money, look like Walmart
Like corner stores, like cash registers singing
Black sound like four-hundred years, smell like Oprah!
Impactful like Martin, look like Cicely Tyson
Sing like Nina, got a ass like Serena
Feel like broken homes and Section 
Black smell like crack and collard greens
Sounds motivational, feels like church
Look like big Sunday hats and ribbons
See Tank and the Bangas Live
Get tickets as low as $
You might also like
Smile like your mama
Eyes like the sun
Beautiful child, oh, you're the one
Fly like your daddy
Make me so happy
Beautiful child, oh, you're the one
Sound like thick plaits swingin' and sneaky uncles
Look like Tyler Perry making money
Sound like hating, feel frustrating, don't it?
Like they don't get it, like they won't ever get it, huh?
Like, ""Push your personal feelings of racial injustice so far underneath the carpet
That you trip over your own family history!""
But I love me some Black folk
I love the hair grease and the rental fees
The front row seats, the police, the projects, the mustard greens
Being late, social security checks, government assistance
Bougie Black looking good
Bags of hair, fake press on nails, rat tail combs, stunting gold Jean, gold teeth
Black men and big feet
I love me some Black folk
For they are the people that were made from the darkest parts of the sky
Smile like your mama
Eyes like the sun
Beautiful child, oh, you're the one
Fly like your daddy
Make me so happy
Beautiful child, oh, you're the one
I'm in a place when I see your face
Must be nostalgia, ah
I'll never forget the day that we met
Beautiful child, oh, you're the one (Yeah)
Ah-ah-ah
Black, don't crack, I love your skin
I don't see that from other kin
It's today, any day
I see me and mine doing different times
Pushing boundaries
West Coast, East Coast, overseas
From the , what you think I came to LA for? (Aww!)
Everybody from the , what you think I came to LA for?
Everybody from the , what you think I came to LA for?
Everybody from the , what you think I came to LA for?
Everybody from the , (Woo!) what you think I came to LA for?
Everybody from the , everybody from the , yeah!
Everybody from the !

I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him

I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings
